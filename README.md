LRR-Discoverr
=============

This project was a collaboration with Jodi Schwarz and Joseph Azofeifa to create a Hidden Markov Model Database set that would outperform existing methods for detecting Leucine Rich Repeats (LRR) in protein sequences, in particular, LRRs in G Protein-Coupled Receptors (LGR). The two families we were interested in were Toll-like and Follicle Stimulating Hormone Receptors. This work is the subject of a pending scientific publication.
